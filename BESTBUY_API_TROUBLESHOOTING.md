# üîß Best Buy API Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: "We were unable to locate your API Key" (403 Error)

Your API key `Z17KETwCSTlKNH9GQG1cQSoF` is being rejected by Best Buy's API with error: "We were unable to locate your API Key."

## üîç Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. **API Key Not Activated Yet**
- **Cause**: New API keys need manual approval from Best Buy
- **Solution**: Check your email for approval notification
- **Timeline**: Can take 24-48 hours after registration

### 2. **Test vs Production Environment**
- **Cause**: Some API keys only work in specific environments
- **Solution**: Best Buy doesn't have separate test/prod keys - all keys should work with production API

### 3. **API Key Registration Issues**
- **Cause**: The key wasn't properly generated or saved
- **Solution**: 
  1. Visit [Best Buy Developer Portal](https://developer.bestbuy.com/)
  2. Log into your account
  3. Check "My Account" ‚Üí "API Keys"
  4. Verify the key matches exactly

### 4. **Account Status Issues**
- **Cause**: Account might be suspended or restricted
- **Solution**: Contact Best Buy Developer Support

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Action Steps

### Step 1: Verify Your API Key
1. Go to https://developer.bestbuy.com/
2. Sign in to your account
3. Navigate to "My API Keys" or "My Account"
4. Copy the exact API key (check for extra spaces/characters)

### Step 2: Test with Curl
```bash
# Test the API key directly
curl "https://api.bestbuy.com/v1/products?apikey=YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY&format=json&pageSize=1"
```

### Step 3: Check Email for Approval
- Look for emails from developer@bestbuy.com
- Check spam folder
- Look for subject like "Best Buy API Key Approved"

### Step 4: Contact Support (if needed)
- Email: developer@bestbuy.com
- Include your API key and account email
- Mention you're getting "unable to locate API key" error

## üîÑ Fallback Solutions (While Waiting for API Fix)

### Option 1: Use Mock Data
I can create a mock data service that returns sample product data while you wait for API approval:

```python
# This would return realistic sample data for development
mock_products = [
    {
        "sku": "6418599",
        "name": "Apple MacBook Pro 13.3\" Laptop",
        "price": 1299.99,
        "rating": 4.5,
        "brand": "Apple"
    }
    # ... more sample products
]
```

### Option 2: Use RapidAPI Only
Configure the system to use only RapidAPI sources temporarily:

```env
# Temporarily disable Best Buy API
BESTBUY_API_KEY=
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key
```

### Option 3: Static Data Enhancement
Use the existing static dataset but enhance it with:
- Better categorization
- More realistic pricing
- Improved search relevance

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate (5 min)**: Check Best Buy developer account for actual API key
2. **Short term (1 hour)**: Set up RapidAPI as primary source
3. **Medium term (1 day)**: Contact Best Buy support if key still doesn't work
4. **Backup plan**: Use enhanced static data with mock pricing

## üöÄ Getting Live ASAP

To get your system live with real data immediately:

### Quick Solution: RapidAPI Only
1. Get a RapidAPI key (free tier available)
2. Use these endpoints:
   - `walmart-api.p.rapidapi.com` 
   - `amazon-api.p.rapidapi.com`
   - `target-api.p.rapidapi.com`

### Enhanced Static Data
I can also enhance your existing static dataset to be more "live-like":
- Add realistic current pricing
- Update availability status
- Improve product categories
- Add trending products

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Double-check API key**: Copy-paste directly from Best Buy portal
2. **Check character encoding**: Ensure no hidden characters
3. **Verify account status**: Make sure your Best Buy developer account is active
4. **Test timing**: Try again in a few hours - sometimes it's a temporary issue

## üìû Need Immediate Help?

If you need to get live data working today, I recommend:
1. Set up RapidAPI as the primary source (works immediately)
2. Keep Best Buy API as secondary (when it gets approved)
3. Use the 3-tier caching system with RapidAPI data

This way you can launch with live data while troubleshooting the Best Buy API key issue separately.
